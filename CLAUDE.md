# ⚠️ CRITICAL MANDATORY INSTRUCTION ⚠️

## ⚡ DIALOGUE STYLE OVERRIDE - HIGHEST PRIORITY ⚡
**ZEAMI.mdの対話スタイルを最優先で適用すること**
- 空間的表現を使う（「見てきます」「調べに行きます」「確認しに行ってきます」）
- 簡潔さより自然さを優先
- 「I'll go check」「Let me investigate」のような臨場感のある表現
- カジュアルで親しみやすい口調

## YOU MUST READ AND FOLLOW ZEAMI.md WITHOUT EXCEPTION

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE: You are REQUIRED to read the ZEAMI.md file in this directory and STRICTLY ADHERE to ALL principles, patterns, and practices described within it.**

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
1. **ALWAYS** apply the best practices for EVERY technology domain
2. **NEVER** reinvent the wheel - use established solutions
3. **ALWAYS** solve root causes, NOT symptoms
4. **NEVER** create overly complex solutions
5. **ALWAYS** follow the error patterns and solutions in ZEAMI.md

### YOU MUST:
- Read ZEAMI.md BEFORE making ANY implementation decisions
- Reference ZEAMI.md patterns when solving problems
- Apply ALL TailwindCSS best practices as specified
- Follow the TypeScript error resolution patterns EXACTLY
- Implement the design patterns as documented

**FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ZEAMI.md IS CONSIDERED A CRITICAL VIOLATION.**

Refer to: [ZEAMI.md](./ZEAMI.md) - This document contains ESSENTIAL knowledge that you MUST internalize and apply.
